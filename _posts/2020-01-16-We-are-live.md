Finally stretching my arms after managing to wrangle Jekyll to get an OK theme to have it editable for me only after trying countless times trying to find a theme suitable for me and be editable along with not dealing with dependency hell of Ruby and sometimes Node.js on my Windows environment - and yes I am using Windows to try to do web development.

But yeah, I felt like it's a matter of time where I finally have a place to lay out my judgment-free thoughts on some rather technical stuff that I felt like people who would stumble upon this site may or may not be interested in those talk... if those talks are about 3D development and Web Development.

But other than that. Welcome to my humble abode. It's still a work in progress as I want it to be a proper landing page for people who is curious about what I do.

As of late I had been working on doing some pure GLSL programming and you can check it out on this GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/EndyPremier/GLSLWorks).
